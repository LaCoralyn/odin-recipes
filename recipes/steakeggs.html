       <h3>The best steak and egg recipe</h3>
        
       <p> My favorite breakfast food. Good source of protein and a great way
        to start the day.</p>
        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>
            One 1 pound sirlion steak (about 1 inch thick)
        </li>
    <li>Koshe salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>8 large eggs</li>
</ul>
<h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the over 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until hot, about 5 minutes. 
            Raise the heat to high and add the oil. Season the steak generously with salt and pepper. Place the steak in the skillet and cook, 
            turning once, until well-browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the steak in 
            the skillet to the oven and cook for 5 minutes more for medium-rare</li>
        <li>Transfer the steak to a cutting board. Cover it loosely with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before carving</li>
        <li>While the steak is resting, cook the eggs. Heat 2 skillets over medium-low. Melt a tablespoon of butter in each pan. Break 4 eggs into each skillet. 
            Season the eggs lightly with salt and pepper, and cook until the whites are just set, about 3 1/2 minutes. (If you want the yolks to be cooked through, cover, and continue cooking 
            for 1 to 2 minutes more.) Divide the eggs among 4 warmed plates</li>
        <li>Cut the steak on the diagonal into thick slices. Fan the steak slices on the plates and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
