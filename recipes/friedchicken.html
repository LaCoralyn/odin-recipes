        <h3>Description</h3>
        Southern cooking is all about deep frying and using the best ingredients like cheese and bacon. 
        It may not be the healthiest cuisine, but its perfect when you need some good ol comfort food.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fried chicken is my absolute favorite Southern dish. Sure, 
        its simple its basically just chicken coated in batter and then deep-fried until golden brown.
        Yet somehow, it tastes like heaven!

       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li> 2 whole free-range, organic chickens</li>
        <li> Vegetables oil of choice, for frying the chicken</li>
        <li> 6 cups of all purpose flour</li>
        <li> 5 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li> 4 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
        <li> 2 cups buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce (optional, for added flavor), 
            salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Add in chicken pieces. 
            Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours </li>
        <li>When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is 
            about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees. </li>
        <li>Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized 
            resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly. </li>
        <li>Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place 
            it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess.</li>
        <li>Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature
             of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, 
            until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F</li>
        <li>Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving</li>
        </ol>
